# automated-dustbin
AIM:
The "Smart Dustbin" project leverages Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor to create an automated waste disposal solution. The system can detect nearby individuals using the ultrasonic sensor and respond by opening its lid to facilitate convenient disposal. This report provides an overview of the project, its components, and the functionality it offers. The software used here is Tinker cad for simulation purpose and we have used fritzing software for designing a PCB thereby to generate a Gerber file.

RESULT: 
In conclusion, the Automated Smart Dustbin System represents a transformative leap in waste management and sanitation.From this experiment, we have analysed the working of automated dustbin system with a software (tinkercad) and verified the results successfully.
